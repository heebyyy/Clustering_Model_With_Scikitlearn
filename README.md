# Clustering_Model_With_Scikitlearn

The data used for the simple Kmean clustering in this repository is randomly generated. This consists of three clusters with 50 item in each category, making upa dataset of 150


The second dataset used for clustering in this repository is the iris dataset. This isused toillustrate how kmeans clustering performs with a dataset with more than two features. The iris dataset is one of the dataset built-in in scikit-learn and can also be downloaded at from UCI machine learning repository.
